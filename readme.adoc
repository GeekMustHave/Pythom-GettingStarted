It is the day before Thanksgiving, what I have come to call a `Learning Day`.  A day where I pick something I need to learn more about and just get started.

Python is everywhere.  From the small little Gemma Zero from Adafruit all the way up to the large parallel systems.  This should be my second language next to JavaScript/Node.


== Install Python Windows 

Verify Version

.Python Version
[source, powershell]
----
PS D:\Users\jschust2\Dropbox\myDev\Python-Journey\GettingStarted> python --version
Python 3.6.3
----

=== Install Latest version

If installed version is much older than current, update it.

.Python Update

Check the Python path option.

.Python Options

NOTE:  If you are running Python from within vsCode you may have to restart vsCode to get the most current version of Python.



== vsCode and Python

Microsoft has an vsCode extension with 23 million downloads, sounds safe.

=== Install the linter

.Install Python Linter
[source, powershell]
----
 python -m pip install -U pylint --user
----



== Python basics

=== Syntax

* Python has no mandatory statement termination characters and blocks are specified by indentation. 
* *Indent to begin a block*, dedent to end one. Statements that expect an indentation level end in a colon (:). 
* Comments start with the pound (#) sign and are single-line
* Multi-line strings are used for multi-line comments. 
* Values are assigned (in fact, objects are bound to names) with the equals sign (`=`)
* Equality testing is done using two equals signs (`==`). 
* Increment/decrement values using the `+=` and `-=` operators respectively by the right-hand amount.
* Keywords are the reserved words in Python.  Keywords are case sensitive.
* Statements can extend over multiple lines with the line continuation character `(\)`.
* Boolean `True` is a `1`, 'False` is a `0`
* `Null` is now `None`

=== Object-Orientated Programming

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) comes built into the Python language. 
It lays down a model which derive a solution by creating objects, defining relationships, and binding data.
However, the procedural programming methodology takes on a top-down approach and solves one problem at a time while splitting it into smaller ones. 
On the other hand, OOP is a bottom-up problem-solving technique which seeks a blueprint of the solution at the onset and leaves implementation for the later.

=== Clear Screen

This is much more complicated than it needed to be.  
Whats wrong with `clear`?

.Clear Screen
[source, python]
----
import os
_=os.system("clear")
----

=== Literal Collections

* *List* - `fruits = ['apple', 'orange', 'bannana']`
* *Tuple* - `numbers = (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)`
* *Dictionary* -`ham = {'a':'Alpha', 'b': 'Bravo', 'c': 'Charlie'}`
* *Set* - `vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}`


=== Data types

Every value in Python has a datatype. 
Since everything is an object in Python programming, 
data types are actually classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes.

*Integers* - as big a number as you need

*Float* - up to 15 decimal points

*Complex* - `x + yj` where `x` is the real part, `y` is the imaginary part???

*Lists* - `a = [5,10,12,32,118]` then `a[3]` would be `32` indexing starts at zero, a[3]=666 replaces item in list.  
Very much like a simple array

*Tuple* - Tuple is an ordered sequence of items same as list.The only difference is that tuples are immutable. 
Tuples once created cannot be modified.

Tuples are used to write-protect data and are usually faster than list as it cannot change dynamically.

`stuff = ('Diodes', 45, 1.25)`, then `stuff[1]` would be `45`.

*Sets* - Unordered collection of unique items. Set is defined by values separated by comma inside braces { }. Items in a set are not ordered. Since, set are unordered collection, indexing has no meaning. Hence the slicing operator [] does not work.
Set have unique values. They eliminate duplicates.

`a = {1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,5}` then `a` becomes `{1,2,3,4,5}`

*Dictionary* - Dictionary is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.
It is generally used when we have a huge amount of data. Dictionaries are optimized for retrieving data. 
We must know the key to retrieve the value.

So `morse = {'a': ".-", 'b': "_..", 'c': "_._."}` and `morse['a']` would return `.-`

== `constants.py` Program

.constants.py program code
[source, python]
----
include::./constant.py[]
----


== `python1.py` Program

.python1.py program code
[source, python]
----
include::./python1.py[]
----

 
=== `python1.py` results

Here are the results from the python program
